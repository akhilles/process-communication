# Process Communication: Linux Processes and IPC
Given a list of integers find the Minimum, Maximum, and the Sum of the numbers. The list will be in a text file you generate. You may use any form of interprocess communication (IPC) to partition the file/array into chunks and distribute work to more than one processes (if there are multiple ones) (e.g., pipes, shared memory, or additional (perhaps more sophisticated) inherent process system calls).

## How to execute:  
Problem 1:  
`./p1.sh <input file> <output file>`

Problem 2:  
`./p2.sh <input file> <output file> <number of processes>`

Problem 3:  
`./p3.sh <input file> <output file> <number of processes>`

Problem 4:  
`./p4.sh <input file> <output file> <depth of process tree>`
