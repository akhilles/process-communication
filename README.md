# Process Communication: Linux Processes and IPC  

## Problem:  
Given a list of integers find the Minimum, Maximum, and the Sum of the numbers. The list will be in a text file you generate. You may use any form of interprocess communication (IPC) to partition the file/array into chunks and distribute work to more than one processes (if there are multiple ones) (e.g., pipes, shared memory, or additional (perhaps more sophisticated) inherent process system calls).

## How to execute:  
`
./p*.sh
`
